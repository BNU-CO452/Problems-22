# Week 2 Problem: Mario World
This problem is based on a 2D platform game called Mario, where Mario has to move from left to
right, climbing up structures and jumping over gaps as needed.

In this problem we need to complete the createPyramid() method such that the method can draw
a Pyramid composed of blocks, each block is exactly the same size as a single tile.  The method
should be able to draw pyramids of different sizes between one block high and 8 blocks high.

The example pyramid below is of size = 3, so has three blocks at the base, and is 3 blocks at its highest
point.  The two halves of the pyramid are separated by 2 tiles, so that Mario has to jump
over the gap in the final game.
